My name is Xavier and I'm a Game Developer!

I consider myself a problem-solver, hardworking and curious. Most of my experience comes from a personal itch to understand how things work. I started ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù at six years old on a Commodore 64 using Logo, then moved on to BASIC, Pascal, C++, and haven‚Äôt stopped since. My first real involvement in game development was when GarageGames open-sourced the Torque Game Engine ‚Äî back in a time when game engines were closely guarded secrets and licenses cost millions. That moment opened the door for me, and I never looked back.

Recently I worked as a Technical Director at Globant, a large software services company, where I lead multiple teams (over 100 people) focused on AAA game development. My role involved a mix of mentorship, technical planning, architecture, and building core systems for the team to expand on. That said, I still code often, both at work and in my personal time ‚Äî because programming isn‚Äôt just my job; it‚Äôs what I love doing.

When I‚Äôm not working, I‚Äôm usually experimenting. I‚Äôm constantly learning new things or prototyping new ideas ‚Äî from writing a Gameboy emulator to a basic OS. One of my longest-running personal projects is Spark, a custom rendering engine supporting ray-traced GI running on DirectX 12 with an API abstraction layer (Vulkan is WIP). I‚Äôve also built many prototypes in Unreal Engine ‚Äî from spherical planets using clipmaps, to rebuilding Unreals Character Movement Component to support dynamic gravity and movement inside moving and rotating vehicles (spaceships).

You can find some of my work at https://github.com/xamado and https://xamado.github.io/projects/. Most of it is exploratory, the product of late nights driven by curiosity rather than deadlines ‚Äî but it shows my range, drive, and technical curiosity.

I take pride in being proactive and thorough. I enjoy fixing bugs and understanding systems deeply. If someone tells me code "just started working," I‚Äôll keep digging until I break it again and understand why. I favor clean, data-oriented solutions over overly abstract OOP designs ‚Äî code should solve problems, not introduce new ones. (Though I‚Äôm well aware that sometimes we must work within messy systems ‚Äî hi Unreal! üëã)

Outside of programming, I enjoy flying airplanes. I hold a private pilot‚Äôs license and am currently working toward my commercial certification ‚Äî another lifelong goal rooted in curiosity and challenge.

# Experience

### Technical Director - Globant
###### Mar 2016 - Present

As Technical Director at Globant's Gaming Studio I led the studio's game development practice, followed new business opportunities, empowered our teams and developers to grow and just in general helped the studio move forward.

I have led the Ubisoft - Globant collaboration for over 8 years, finding places where we could add value to the AAA titles developed by Ubisoft. We started with just 3 engineers and through trust and good work we grew to a peak of around 80 developers on 3 different projects.

I was responsible for assembling a team of not only excellent engineers but great forward going people, which aids in having great team dynamics and collaboration which in turn helped us tackle more and more advanced game engine technology projects and kept the teams learning and growing while still always surpassing our client's expectations.

I was also responsible for identifying new opportunities where we could provide help and followed new business opportunities within other game projects to find engagements where we could grow our business and collaboration.

#### Technical Director - Bandai Namco

Tech: Unreal Engine 5.3, C++

Worked as Director and programmer on 2 new unannounced projects for Bandai Namco Japan based on the Gundam IP.

Both projects were developed from the ground up on Unreal Engine 5. I developed core systems for the games and a separate networking system based on a custom server to align with the needs of an MMO style game experience.

For one of these projects I was prototyping game mechanics, leveraging Epic‚Äôs Gameplay Ability System to come up with a clean and modular design to the dozens and dozens of game mechanics we wanted our players to play with.

#### Technical Director - XDefiant

Tech: Ubisofts Snowdrop Engine, C++

We have worked on Ubisoft's XDefiant from the first stages of conception. Our biggest collaboration with Ubisoft yet; with a team of over 50 people working on multiple aspects of the game from UI and Gameplay to Dedicated Servers, Networking and Stadia/Luna ports.

#### Technical Director - Rocksmith+

Tech: C++, Custom UI rendering system (DX), C#/.NET, Vue.js

We created the whole Rocksmith+ Workshop ecosystem, from the authoring tool to the website and API/services allowing users to create their own songs for playing in the game and publish them for other users to play.

I assembled and led the team working Rocksmith+ Workshop, a whole new content creation tool for authoring tracks for the game, meant to be used by our users to create exciting new tracks to play in Rocksmith+. The tool was created from scratch using C++ and a custom UI engine designed by myself and built in-house with the Globant team.

#### Technical Director - FarCry 6

Tech: Ubisofts Dunia Engine

Assembled and led the Globant team working on FarCry 6, where we developed engine, rendering, tools and gameplay elements for the upcoming new iteration of the franchise. We collaborated with Ubisoft's team in Toronto. I've continually pushed on getting more parts of the game for our team to work on, constantly showing our capabilities and expertise, and how a small team can produce a huge impact on the quality of life for everyone working with the tools to make such a great game.

### Senior Software Engineer - Rabbit Inc.
###### Nov 2014 - Jan 2016

I was part of a team of very versatile developers, the position demanded being able to constantly switch priorities and technologies, if it's new, learn it.

I developed backend solutions using node.js to support the video chat app with thousands of concurrent users. I also developed new tech as we grew to be able to scale, our systems had to support thousands and thousands of servers all working together in a fail-safe environment.

I developed our own messaging queue system supporting unicast and multicast events on top of Redis.

I also did front end web development (CSS, JS, and all the related awful technologies, heh), iOS (objective-c), C++ (cpu intensive video processing) and Java.

### Technical Leader - Globant
###### Mar 2013 - Oct 2014

As a technical leader at Globant I participated in several projects, but the following two are the most memorable:

#### Technical Leader - DC Legends

Worked on Warner's DC Legends mobile game, on-site at the Warner San Francisco offices. Implemented game play features in Unity and helped the backend team with the node.js server since I already had some previous experience with it and node.js was new to them.

#### Technical Leader - Rabbit

Lead a team of developers porting Rabbit's application from OSX and Objective-C to Windows using C++14 while at the same time implementing exciting new features using AMD's hardware accelerated video encoding and face recognition on a prototype CPU.

Also worked on some server components built on top of node.js.

### Senior Developer - UMAUCO
###### 2012 - 2013

Worked on developing a custom social platform from the ground up using PHP and Symfony, where I developed both the backend and frontend portions of the system.

### Senior Game Developer - Minor Studios
###### Feb 2011 - Dec 2011

Worked on Atmosphir, an online adventure creation game. The project was built from the ground up using the Unity 3D engine. The game included cross platform gaming clients and an online component.

- Developed game play features and editor tools used to streamline the art and asset creation process.
- Implemented work methodologies, coding style guidelines, automated build servers, ticketing processes, milestone definitions, release process checklist.
- Worked on performance optimization. This work accomplished many performance increases throughout the game.

### Chief Architect - Sabarasa Entertainment
###### Sep 2007 - Nov 2010

Having started originally as a contractor I ended taking up the full time position of Chief Architect for the company. During this time I led our development teams working on in-house game titles for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS platforms.

Additionally we also worked for Garage Games Inc. porting Torque Game Engine, Torque 3D, and Torque 2D to the Wii and PSP consoles, effort in which I personally developed all of the rendering tech and most of the low level platform code (the total engine porting team was a whopping 2 devs)
