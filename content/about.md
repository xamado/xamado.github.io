My name is Xavier Amado and I'm a Game Developer!

I consider myself a problem-solver, hardworking and curious individual, most of my experience comes from a personal itch about learning how things work. 

I started "programming" when I was only 6 years old on a Commodore64 using Logo, then moved on to Basic, Pascal, C++ and never stopped. My first involvement in real game development was when GarageGames open-sourced the Torque Game Engine, back in a world where Game Engines were close guarded secrets and licenses costed millions, it was a great learning opportunity for me.

Out ouf curiosity and a "I'm sure I can do it" attitude, I also dwelved into other industries like Web, Servers, Video encoding, etc, but I always returned to my true passion, games.

Currently I'm working as a Technical Director at Globant, a software service provider company, leading much of our efforts into Game Development. Even though I don't have much contact with code on my day to day work I still feel joy on knowing that I'm giving over 80+ people the opportunity to learn and work on AAA game projects, a rare opportunity in my country. That being said, I never stopped working on my pet programming projects.

When I step away from the computer I enjoy flying airplanes, I got my private pilots license and I'm currently working towards my commercial.

# Experience

### Technical Director - Globant
###### Mar 2016 - Present

As Technical Director at Globant's Gaming Studio I lead the studio's game development practice, follow new business opportunities, empower our teams and developers to grow and just in general help the studio move forward. 

I have led the Ubisoft - Globant collaboration from conception to date, finding places where we could add value to the AAA titles developed by Ubisoft.

I lead a team of 80+ developers.

I am responsible of assembling a team of not only excellent engineers but great forward going people, which aids in having great team dynamics and collaboration which in turn helps us tackle more and more advanced game engine technology projects and keeps the team learning and growing while still always surpassing our client's expectations.

I'm also responsible of identifying new opportunities where we can provide help and follow new business opportunities within other game projects.

#### Technical Director - XDefiant

We are currently collaborating with Ubisoft on an upcoming (and announced) title, XDefiant. Our biggest commitment yet with Ubisoft with a team of over 50 people working on multiple aspects of the game from UI and Gameplay to Dedicated Servers, Networking and Stadia/Luna ports.

#### Technical Director - Rocksmith+

We created the whole Rocksmith+ Workshop ecosystem, allowing users to create their own songs for playing in the game.

Assembled and lead the team working Rocksmith+ Workshop, a whole new content creation tool for authoring tracks for the game, meant to be used by our users to create exciting new tracks to play in Rocksmith+. The tool was created from scratch using C++ and a custom UI engine designed by myself and built in-house with the Globant team.

I designed and developed the core of the custom hardware accelerated UI framework.

#### Technical Director - FarCry 6

Assembled and lead the Globant team working on FarCry 6, where we developed engine, rendering, tools and gameplay elements for the upcoming new iteration of the franchise. We collaborated with Ubisoft's team in Toronto. I've continually pushed on getting more parts of the game for our team to work on, constantly showing our capabilities and expertise, and how a small team can produce a huge impact on the quality of life for everyone working with the tools to make such a great game.

### Senior Software Engineer - Rabbit Inc.
###### Nov 2014 - Jan 2016

I was part of a team of very versatile developers, the position demanded being able to constantly switch priorities and technologies, if it's new, learn it.

I developed backend solutions using node.js to support the video chat app with thousands of concurrent users. I also developed new tech as we grew to be able to scale, our systems had to support thousands and thousands of servers all working together in a fail-safe environment.

I developed our own messaging queue system supporting unicast and multicast events on top of Redis.

I also did front end web development (CSS, JS, and all the related awful technologies, heh), iOS (objective-c), C++ (cpu intensive video processing) and Java.

### Technical Leader - Globant
###### Mar 2013 - Oct 2014

As a technical leader at Globant I participated in several projects, but the following two are the most memorable:

#### Technical Leader - DC Legends

Worked on Warner's DC Legends mobile game, on-site at the Warner San Francisco offices. Implemented game play features in Unity and helped the backend team with the node.js server since I already had some previous experience with it and node.js was new to them.

#### Technical Leader - Rabbit

Lead a team of developers porting Rabbit's application from OSX and Objective-C to Windows using C++14 while at the same time implementing exciting new features using AMD's hardware accelerated video encoding and face recognition on a prototype CPU.

Also worked on some server components built on top of node.js.
