### Technical Director - Globant

As Technical Director at Globant's Gaming Studio I lead the studio's game development practice, follow new business opportunities, empower our teams and developers to grow and just in general help the studio move forward. 

#### Technical Director - Rocksmith+

#### Technical Director - FarCry 6

Assembled and lead the Globant team working on FarCry 6, where we developed engine, rendering, tools and gameplay elements for the upcoming new iteration of the franchise. We collaborated with Ubisoft's team in Toronto.
