Most of my experience comes from a personal itch to understand how things work. I started ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù at six years old on a Commodore 64 using Logo, then moved on to BASIC, Pascal, C++, and haven‚Äôt stopped since. My first real involvement in game development was when GarageGames open-sourced the Torque Game Engine ‚Äî back in a time when game engines were closely guarded secrets and licenses cost millions. That moment opened the door for me, and I never looked back.</p><p>Recently I worked as a Technical Director at Globant, a large software services company, where I lead multiple teams (over 100 people) focused on AAA game development. My role involved a mix of mentorship, technical planning, architecture, and building core systems for the team to expand on. That said, I still code often, both at work and in my personal time ‚Äî because programming isn‚Äôt just my job; it‚Äôs what I love doing.</p><p>When I‚Äôm not working, I‚Äôm usually experimenting. I‚Äôm constantly learning new things or prototyping new ideas ‚Äî from writing a Gameboy emulator to a basic OS. One of my longest-running personal projects is Spark, a custom rendering engine supporting ray-traced GI running on DirectX 12 with an API abstraction layer (Vulkan is WIP). I‚Äôve also built many prototypes in Unreal Engine ‚Äî from spherical planets using clipmaps, to rebuilding Unreals Character Movement Component to support dynamic gravity and movement inside moving and rotating vehicles (spaceships).</p><p>You can find some of my work at <a href=https://github.com/xamado class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/xamado</a> and <a href=https://xamado.github.io/projects/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://xamado.github.io/projects/</a>. Most of it is exploratory, the product of late nights driven by curiosity rather than deadlines ‚Äî but it shows my range, drive, and technical curiosity.</p><p>I take pride in being proactive and thorough. I enjoy fixing bugs and understanding systems deeply. If someone tells me code &ldquo;just started working,&rdquo; I‚Äôll keep digging until I break it again and understand why. I favor clean, data-oriented solutions over overly abstract OOP designs ‚Äî code should solve problems, not introduce new ones. (Though I‚Äôm well aware that sometimes we must work within messy systems ‚Äî hi Unreal! üëã)</p><p>Outside of programming, I enjoy flying airplanes. I hold a private pilot‚Äôs license and am currently working toward my commercial certification ‚Äî another lifelong goal rooted in curiosity and challenge.</p><h1 id=skills>Skills
