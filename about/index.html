Most of my experience comes from a personal itch to understand how things work. I started “programming” at six years old on a Commodore 64 using Logo, then moved on to BASIC, Pascal, C++, and haven’t stopped since. My first real involvement in game development was when GarageGames open-sourced the Torque Game Engine — back in a time when game engines were closely guarded secrets and licenses cost millions. That moment opened the door for me, and I never looked back.</p><p>Recently I worked as a Technical Director at Globant, a large software services company, where I lead multiple teams (over 100 people) focused on AAA game development. My role involved a mix of mentorship, technical planning, architecture, and building core systems for the team to expand on. That said, I still code often, both at work and in my personal time — because programming isn’t just my job; it’s what I love doing.</p><p>When I’m not working, I’m usually experimenting. I’m constantly learning new things or prototyping new ideas — from writing a Gameboy emulator to a basic OS. One of my longest-running personal projects is Spark, a custom rendering engine supporting ray-traced GI running on DirectX 12 with an API abstraction layer (Vulkan is WIP). I’ve also built many prototypes in Unreal Engine — from spherical planets using clipmaps, to rebuilding Unreals Character Movement Component to support dynamic gravity and movement inside moving and rotating vehicles (spaceships).</p><p>You can find some of my work at <a href=https://github.com/xamado class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/xamado</a> and <a href=https://xamado.github.io/projects/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://xamado.github.io/projects/</a>. Most of it is exploratory, the product of late nights driven by curiosity rather than deadlines — but it shows my range, drive, and technical curiosity.</p><p>I take pride in being proactive and thorough. I enjoy fixing bugs and understanding systems deeply. If someone tells me code &ldquo;just started working,&rdquo; I’ll keep digging until I break it again and understand why. I favor clean, data-oriented solutions over overly abstract OOP designs — code should solve problems, not introduce new ones. (Though I’m well aware that sometimes we must work within messy systems — hi Unreal! 👋)</p><p>Outside of programming, I enjoy flying airplanes. I hold a private pilot’s license and am currently working toward my commercial certification — another lifelong goal rooted in curiosity and challenge.</p><h1 id=skills>Skills
